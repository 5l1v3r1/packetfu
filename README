= PacketFu

== Installation

PacketFu should live somewhere in your path. I havenâ€˜t decided yet on packaging, mainly because I need to figure out what works best for Linux/Win/OSX (and FreeBSD, and Solaris maybe); your best bet is to just drop it into /usr/local/lib/site_ruby/1.8 or where ever you install bindata to.

== Requirements

BinData: http://bindata.rubyforge.org

Dion Mendel's BinData is absolutely critical for PacketFu.

PcapRub: www.metasploit.com/svn/framework3/trunk/external/pcaprub

Marshall Beddoe's PcapRub is required only for packet reading and writing from a network interfaces (which is a pretty big only). PcapRub itself relies on libpcap 0.9.8 or later for packet injection. It also requires root privilieges to access the interface directly.
