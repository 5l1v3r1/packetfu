== Version 1.0.0 # to be released July 29, 2010
	Missed a bunch of updates in the Changelog. Mea culpa.
	Squashed all Ruby version bugs -- works now on 1.8.6, 1.8.7, 1.9.1, and 1.9.2-head.
	Added ENV['IFACE'] parsing for interface selection. Sadly, rvmsudo doesn't preserve ENV by default, but system ruby should work fine. 
	Removed my own distros of pcaprub. You're on your own, now, but shadowbq's or Metasploit's versions should do just fine.

== Version 0.1.1 # February 18, 2009
	Added .is_proto? functions, self.proto function, Packet.headers attr_accessor across the board.
	Removed dependency on pcaprub to read pcap-formatted files. (r54)
	Added ability to preserve timestamps when reading files using :keep_ts => true argument on Read#f2a and Write honors both saved timestamp or invented timestamps. (r55)
  Various minor bugs. (r56)
	Relaxed the requirement for PcapRub to 0.7-dev now that I handle packet reading on my own. Windows users and threading will be broke without 0.8-dev, though. (r57)
	Endianness of pcap files (for both reading and writing) is now supported (r58).
	Handle non-version-4 IP packets correctlier (r59) (thanks tmanning!).
	Merge of Metasploit-local patches, including Write.append (byte-order safe). (r60)

== Version 0.1.0 # September 13, 2008
  Various minor bugs fixed.
  Added a Windows compatability mode via a compiled pcaprub.
    Note: Works fine on XP, works okay on Vista. Users are encouraged to compile their own pcaprub installations.

== Verison 0.0.3 # September 3, 2008 # r25
  First tagged version. Naturally, bugs were found that moment.

== Version 0.3.0 # January 11, 2010 # r129
  Rewrote pretty much everything using Struct instead of BinData. Huge success.
  Start to get back in the habit of documentation changes.

== Version 0.3.1 # FUTURE
  r130: Add convenience methods for checking the version.
  r131: Fix TCP option setting.
	r132: pcaprub to 0.9-dev.
