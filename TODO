TODO for PacketFu

Next version:

Ensure pcaprub is loaded sensibly -- Windows version still probably isn't right in all cases.
Rewrite TCPOpts to be safe and sane -- use BinData structs
Rewrite packet file reading and writing to be pure ruby instead of pcaprub's versions.
Pcapfiles should take and honor usec fields.
Add HD's .is_tcp? and friends.
Collect HD's patches to ensure compatability with Metasploit
Create a gem distribution

Someday:
Rewrite the whole protocol tree so a simple 'require protocol' is sufficent.
Think about adding taint values to rewritten packets?
Merge in release version of BinData once readeof-patch is committed to a tagged version
Drop version requirements for BinData and Pcaprub once the minimum release versions are sufficient.
