INSTALLATION

Installation is pretty straightforward.

PacketFu requires a slightly hacked version of PcapRub to function effectively.

This distribution provides both pcaprub source (tested on Linux) and
a compiled PcapRub for Win32. For Linux, simply cd to pcaprub_linux, and
run:

% ruby extconf.rb
% make
% sudo make install

For Windows, ensure the pcaprub.so file is locatable in your $RUBYPATH (for
most systems, C:\ruby\bin should be fine).

For PacketFu proper, simply run

% sudo ruby setup.rb

from the toplevel directory to install.

TESTING

The easiest way to test the installation is to run PacketFu via
irb, using the example shell in the "examples" directory:

% sudo irb -r packetfu-shell.rb

After the banner, you should see something like:

>>> Use $packetfu_default.config for salient networking details.

>>> Packet capturing/injecting enabled.

If not, then Something Went Wrong. It's most likely that you have either
an older or broken version of pcaprub (try installing the version provided
with PacketFu), or you have a very, very old version of libpcap (version
0.9.4 is the oldest tested version, and there's really no reason to not
be at least on 1.0.0).
